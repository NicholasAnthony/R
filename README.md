## What is R?

R is a programming language and environment designed for **statistical analysis**, **data visualization**, and **data science**. Developed in the 1990s by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R is widely used in academia, finance, pharmaceuticals, and data-driven industries for its robust statistical tools and graphing capabilities.

## Why Learn R?

- **Data Analysis**: R excels at handling and analyzing large datasets.
- **Visualization**: Create stunning, customizable plots with packages like `ggplot2`.
- **Community and Packages**: Access thousands of packages via CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network).
- **Free and Open-Source**: No cost, and you can contribute to its development!
- **Cross-Industry Use**: Used in data science, bioinformatics, economics, and more.

## Setting Up R

To start coding in R, you'll need to install R and a development environment:

1. **Install R**:
   - Download R from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/).
   - Choose the version for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install RStudio** (optional but recommended):
   - RStudio is a user-friendly IDE for R.
   - Download it from [RStudio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

3. **Verify Installation**:
   - Open R or RStudio and type `R.version` to check your R version.
   ```R
